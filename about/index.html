        <div class="article-body">
        <p>I am 15 years old and a sophomore in high school. I am homeschooled and live with my family in St. Louis Missouri. I have 1 sister and 4 brothers, 2 of which are in college. Luckily I have 2 dogs that more than make up for their lost pressence. I have lots of interests, the biggest of which are reading, gaming, and programming.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Programming. </strong>I love programming. I think about the next thing I'm gonna make pretty much all day. My projects usually revolve around some concept that I find interesting as the creator, rather than actually making something the "best". Most of these projects are games. Like many my age, I was driven to learn to code in the pursuit of making games. As of writing this, I am attempting to deisgn a game which... I honestly don't even know how to describe. Mainly because I'm not even totally sure what it is supposed to be. To see more related to programming and game making, click <a href="#">here</a>#.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Gaming. </strong>Most of the ideas for games to make come from other games that I play or have played. Sometimes just a tiny detail in a game acts as a catalyst for an entire game idea. Unfortunately, Almost none of these have been realized, and it's more than likely they wont be. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just having a vague idea for a game does not mean you can/should actually make a game with it. Either way, I do think any good game maker should play games, a lot of them. A few of the games I have enjoyed the most over the years are Minecraft, Factorio, and Hollow Knight. I would not have anywhere enough space here to list all of my favorites, but these three each represent a different aspect of gaming I enjoy. If you're interested on reading more from myself about gaming and anything related, click <a href="#">here</a>#.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Reading. </strong>I love to read. That includes novels and comics. I've been reading since I was young, much to my dad's delight. My dad is a book salesman and he always made us read, he would get mad at us for playing video games rather than reading, but that never really stopped us. I hope one day I can actually write good stories like the ones I read. At the moment I'm super into Star Wars books, mostly "legends" books, but I've liked most all I've read. </p>

          <p>The reason for this site's existence in short is that I wanted someplace to release my thoughts into the wild, a home for those thoughts as well as any projects/things I might want to preserve. Basically, I'm just going to put whatever I feel like on here. Remember that when you see me rambling on about random stuff for forever with no discernable purpose.</p>
